</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Toby</span>,</p>

<p>The address from which I write to you is familiar in
the public ear in connection with a long series which, such
is the ignorance of mankind, I have heard described as
petulant, querulous, self-adulatory notes. I have often
wondered that it has not occurred to any one to notice
the singular appropriateness of the name of my humble
home. It is not for me, at my time of life, to claim anything
like prescience of affairs. I may have been right in my
views of the succeeding events of the past half-century, or I
may have been wrong. I will
just mention that my friend, <span class="smcap">T-nn-s-n</span>, who has a pretty faculty for poetry,
once summed me up in a couplet which I venture to think is not without its
charm. "<span class="smcap">J-hn Br-ght</span>," he wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><span class="smcap">J-hn Br-ght</span></p>
<p>Is always right.</p>
</div>

<p>He told me in confidence that he had at one time contemplated a eulogistic
poem of some seventy or eighty lines, price to the <i>Nineteenth Century</i> a guinea
each. But, having thrown off this couplet, it appeared in itself so sufficient, so
comprehensive yet so precise, that amplification would have rather reduced than
increased its value. Therefore it remains a brilliant fragment.</p>

<p>But I am wandering from the theme, which, in the present instance, is not
myself but my country address. What I thought might be interesting to point
out is the curious felicity of the nomenclature, and the remarkable foresight of
which it is proof. More than a generation ago it received this singular appellation.
At that time nothing seemed more remote from ordinary apprehension
than that in this year I should be what we call "a Unionist," an ally and
supporter of Lord <span class="smcap">S-l-b-ry</span>, pulling in the same boat as the <span class="smcap">H-m-lt-ns</span>, and
marching shoulder to shoulder with <span class="smcap">Ashm-d B-rtl-tt</span>. In those days I was
wont to pour forth torrents of angry contempt upon the Conservative party.
<span class="smcap">D-sr-li</span> was my wash-pot, over the Markiss I cast out my shoe; but even then
my address was One Ash, Rochdale. Do you begin to see what I mean? One
Empire, One Parliament, One Ash! Some of my old colleagues and disciples
among the Radicals scoff at me because of my new companions. But, as usual,
I have been right from the first. <i>I</i> have always been what the <i>Marchioness</i>
called a "wonner." What has happened is that the Liberal Party and my old
companions have moved away from me, whilst the Conservatives have moved
towards me. I am the same to-day as yesterday, or as these fifty years past.
"<span class="smcap">J-hn Br-ght</span>, always right," and any change of relationship or appearance
is due to the ineradicable error and fatal foolishness of others.</p>

<p>What I feel, dear <span class="smcap">Toby</span>, in reviewing a long and honourable life, is the
terrible feeling of monotony. I sometimes find myself envying ordinary men
like <span class="smcap">Gl-dst-ne</span>, who, looking back over their past life, can put their hand down
and say, "There I blundered, there I was misled by circumstances." For a long
time <span class="smcap">Gl-dst-ne</span> kept pretty straight&mdash;that is to say I agreed with him. But he
has gone wrong lamentably on this Irish Question, and all the righteous acts of
his life&mdash;that is to say, steps in which he has chanced to walk in time with me&mdash;are
obliterated. It is true that, at one time, it was I who was the foremost
Apostle of Irish National feeling. At this date people with inconvenient memories
are constantly raking up passages in my speeches about
Ireland, and the English yoke which, except that they
are too finely cut, and of too noble a style of eloquence,
would exactly suit <span class="smcap">Gl-dst-ne</span> to-day. I said these
things then, it is true, and then they were right. I do
not say them to-day, and therefore they are wrong. <i>Quod
erat demonstrandum.</i> (You will observe that since, with
a distinguished friend, I have joined the political company
of gentlemen, I have forsaken my old habit of
keeping to the Saxon tongue, and sometimes, as here, I
drop into Latin. Occasionally I fall into French. <i>Autres
temps, autres m&oelig;urs.</i>)</p>

<p>My nearest approach to human frailty, is, perhaps, to
be found in a certain measure of absence of suavity. It
is perhaps possible that my temper was,&mdash;I will not say
soured, but&mdash;not sweetened by the vile attacks made upon
me personally by Irish Members in Parliament during
the last ten years. You remember what <span class="smcap">B-nt-nck</span> said
about me? I don't mean Big Ben, or Little Ben, but
Lord <span class="smcap">George B-nt-nck</span>. "If <span class="smcap">Br-ght</span>," he said, "had
not been a Quaker, he would have been a prize-fighter."
I think there is about the remark some suspicion of lack
of respect. But, also, it is not without some foundation
of truth. I admit an impulse to strike back when I am
hit; sometimes when I am not. Through two Parliaments
the ragged regiment that live upon the contributions
of their poor relations in domestic service in the
United States have girded at me in the House of
Commons. This was my reward for the rhetorical
services I did for Ireland a quarter of a century ago.
They pummelled me, kicked me, dragged my honoured
name in the dust, and spat upon me in the market-place.
That gross ingratitude I could never forgive, and if in
reprisal, the cause I once advocated suffers, can I be held
blameable?</p>

<p>But this seems to be running into the groove of apology,
and I never apologised to anyone for anything in my
life. For fear I should begin now, I will close this letter,
remaining,
<span class="author">Your friend,
<span class="i10 smcap">J-hn Br-ght.</span></span></p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I observe that in my haste I have not called you
a fool, or directly stigmatised as such anyone alluded to
in this letter. I am afraid this will be regarded as a sign
of growing weakness. But I will bring up the average
in the next letter I write for publication.</p>

<p>See Christmas is upon us and the world around us living,</p>
<p>Seeks us and asks the pretty gifts it soon would fain be giving.</p>
<p>The stories thrilling, tender, sweet, to suit all tastes and ages,</p>
<p>All gleaming with their covers gay and picture-covered pages;</p>
<p>The dainty illustrated leaf, the paper softly tinted,</p>
<p>In type, to suit young eyes and old, all exquisitely printed:</p>
<p>Of artist's pencil, author's pen, the choicest, fairest flower,</p>
<p>Behold as the glad season comes we thus upon you shower.</p>
</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Messrs. Blackie &amp; Sons.</span></h3>

<div class="poem">
<p>Christmas leaves? Would you pick up the handsomest ones,</p>
<p>First look at these scattered by <span class="smcap">Blackie &amp; Sons</span>.</p>
<p>Here tales of home life and adventure in plenty,</p>
<p>Have good names to vouch for them. Take G. A. <span class="smcap">Henty</span>,</p>
<p>In "Bonnie Prince Charlie" and "Orange and Green,"</p>
<p>He lays first in Scotland, then Ireland his scene,</p>
<p>And thrills you with reading the hairbreadth escapes,</p>
<p>Of the heroes he rescues from numberless scrapes.</p>
<p>But while in "For the Temple," he ventures to tell</p>
<p>How in ages long past great Jerusalem fell;</p>
<p>Yet if less ancient horrors are more to your mind,</p>
<p>In the reign of the "Terror" material you'll find;</p>
<p>And if you would learn how pluck never goes wrong,</p>
<p>You've but to go straightway to "Sturdy and Strong."</p>
<p>Next <span class="smcap">Elizabeth Lysaght</span> in "Aunt Hesba's Charge,"</p>
<p>On the virtues of old Maiden Aunts doth enlarge,</p>
<p>And relates in "Our General" by a small head,</p>
<p>How a family through all its trials may be led.</p>
<p>Then <span class="smcap">J. Percy Groves</span> in "The War of the Axe,"</p>
<p>Tells a stirring Cape story of Caffre attacks,</p>
<p>And "The Seven Wise Scholars" supply <span class="smcap">Ascott R. Hope</span>,</p>
<p>For knocking off seven good tales, ample scope,</p>
<p>He in "Old Renown" stories, too, brilliantly writes</p>
<p>Of the deeds done of old by brave heroes and knights;</p>
<p>While <span class="smcap">E. Brookes</span> harking back with his "Chivalric Days,"</p>
<p>Of the boys and the girls of old times sings the praise.</p>
<p>"Girl Neighbours," allows <span class="smcap">Sarah Tytler</span> to say,</p>
<p>On the whole she prefers the girl of the day;</p>
<p>In "Miss Willowbrown's Offer," how traitors may fail,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sarah Dowdney</span> describes in a well-written tale.</p>
<p>With "The Babbling Teapot," to a little girl changed,</p>
<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Champney</span> has well into Wonderland ranged.</p>
<p>Out of "Willie," who here "Gutta Percha" is named,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George Macdonald</span>, an excellent story has framed,</p>
<p>And has shown how he finds life's troubles prove plastic,</p>
<p>Possessing a brain which his friends deem elastic.</p>
<p>In "The Princess" and "Goblin" he tries a new scheme,</p>
<p>And sweeps you along with his mystical theme;</p>
<p>But when she meets "Curdie" he now and then treads</p>
<p>On ground that is over his young readers' heads.</p>
<p>If a truant's adventures, fair reading you find,</p>
<p>The good ship "Atalanta," you'd bear in your mind,</p>
<p>And you'll follow "aboard" it, the hero whose fate</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Henry Frith's</span> thrilling pages know how to relate.</p>
<p>Next in "Chirp and Chatter" from field and from tree,</p>
<p>Young children taught lessons by <span class="smcap">L. Banks</span> you'll see.</p>
<p>"Queen Maud," with her "orders" by <span class="smcap">Louisa Crow</span>,</p>
<p>Shows pride in a haughty young maiden brought low:</p>
<p>While in the "Squire's Grandson," <span class="smcap">J. Callwell</span> proves how</p>
<p>A small boy can make up a family row.</p>
<p>The stories of <span class="smcap">Wasa</span> and <span class="smcap">Menzikoff</span> tell</p>
<p>Two historical tales, and do it right well.</p>
<p>In his "Dick o' the Fens," one Fen,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Manville Fenn</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>Gives some capital studies of Lincolnshire men;</p>
<p>But in "Sir Walter's Ward," the age of Crusades,</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">William Everard</span> brightly invades.</p>
<p>The "Girlhood" of "Margery Merton" relates,</p>
<p>The struggle that oft a young artist awaits,</p>
<p>And how in the end her brave efforts prevail,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alice Corkran</span> unfolds in her well-written tale.</p>
<p>And if "Clogs," well selected for children to wear,</p>
<p>You're in need, <span class="smcap">Amy Walton</span> will find you "a pair."</p>
<p>If the "Secret" of "Rovers" is more to your taste,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry Collingwood</span> follow,&mdash;your time you'll not waste.</p>
<p>In field, forest, or stream, would you "Insect Ways" learn,</p>
<p>For their "Summer Day's" life to <span class="smcap">J. Humphreys</span> turn.</p>
<p>But to close:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gordon Browne</span>, whose famed pencil so skilled,</p>
<p>Of the foregoing pages so many has filled,</p>
<p>Crowns the whole by contributing last, but not least,</p>
<p>His new "Hop o' my Thumb" and "The Beauty and Beast."</p>
</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">George Routledge &amp; Sons.</span></h3>

<div class="poem">
<p>Are you seeking for young children picture-books to please the eye?</p>
<p>Then your need <span class="smcap">George Routledge</span> and his Sons will readily supply.</p>
<p>Here's "Little Wide-Awake," designed to suit the earliest age,</p>
<p>Bound brightly, with a picture too on nearly every page;</p>
<p>And then there's "Sunny Childhood," with its colouring so gay,</p>
<p>Where Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sale Barker</span> has such pleasant things to say;</p>
<p>And in "Our Friends" and in "Our Home" she takes them by the hand,</p>
<p>And talks to little readers in the words they understand.</p>
<p>"Our Darlings," too, by <span class="smcap">Mars</span>, show how our little darlings fare</p>
<p>Who by their <span class="smcap">Mars</span> (and Pa's as well) are taken everywhere.</p>
<p>If "Fairy Tales" you're seeking, <span class="smcap">Laboulaye's</span> collected lore,</p>
<p>With new ones, and unheard before, will furnish up your store.</p>
<p>And if young heroes of all climes should come within your scope,</p>
<p>You'll turn to "Youngsters' Yarns," and will have faith in <span class="smcap">Ascott Hope</span>.</p>
<p>Then "Herbert Massey's" doings in "Eastern Africa" you'll find,</p>
<p>Told by Commander <span class="smcap">Cameron</span>, quite of a thrilling kind.</p>
<p>"The Children of the New Forest," that <span class="smcap">Marryat</span> wrote of yore,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Paul Hardy</span> and <span class="smcap">John Gilbert</span> join to illustrate once more.</p>
<p>"Round Nature's Dial," by <span class="smcap">H. M. Burnside</span>, tells full and clear</p>
<p>The shifting story of the times and seasons of the year.</p>
<p>The "Annual" for "Every Boy" affords all boys a treat,</p>
<p>Which, thanks to <span class="smcap">Edmund Routledge</span>, may be held as quite complete.</p>
<p>Here "Caldecott's last 'Graphic' Pictures" come in handy guise,</p>
<p>While by her "Book" consulting, the "Young Lady" may grow wise.</p>
<p>How good we'd be if all, before they do, to think would tarry</p>
<p>On what Miss <span class="smcap">Edgeworth</span> taught to "Lucy," "Rosamond," and "Harry."</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="page_268" >[pg 268]</a>

<p>"Natural History," Illustrated "for Young People," must do good,</p>
<p>As a text-book for young children, ably done by <span class="smcap">F. G. Wood</span>.</p>
<p>The "Funny Foxes and their Feats" and doings "at the Fair,"</p>
<p>With some of <span class="smcap">Ernst Griset's</span> happiest efforts may compare.</p>
<p>"The 'Shall Nots' of the Bible" and "Loving Links" combine,</p>
<p>In page illuminated, human verse and text divine.</p>
<p>"Play and Earnest" tells of children who their playing much enjoy,</p>
<p>In a story quaint and charming of a plucky little boy.</p>
<p>Then "Sunbeam Stories," "Storm" and "Sunshine," told in prose and rhyme,</p>
<p>And "Stories" for a "Holiday," as also "Pets' Pastime."</p>
<p>These, with "Sindbad's" famed Adventures, new to many we suppose,</p>
<p>With <span class="smcap">Kate Greenaway's</span> bright Almanack our list must fitly close.</p>

<h2>OUR DEBATING CLUB.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>An apology&mdash;Eloquent Peroration by our Vice-President</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Naylor</span> <i>offers some critical
remarks, and</i> <span class="smcap">Kirkstone</span> <i>relates a humorous anecdote</i>.</p>

<p>I am in a position this week to redeem my promise, and raise the hitherto impenetrable
veil that has long shrouded the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Typographical error, original text read 'proceeedings'.">proceedings</ins>
of the Gargoyle Club from the Public Eye. In
the exercise of the discretion with which I have been entrusted, I have somewhat departed
from the form of report originally contemplated, and selected only the more striking and
characteristic deliverances of my fellow Gargoyles, interspersed with such short notes and
descriptions as may best serve to bring out their several mannerisms and idiosyncrasies.
Should I offend by this I shall deeply regret it, but I find that there are traditions and
customs in the management of a facetious periodical which, however exacting and absurd in
themselves, must be respected by those who would furnish it with literary matter.</p>

<p>Having thus apologised in advance to any honourable Gargoyle who may consider himself
misrepresented or insufficiently reported, let me present, as the first instalment of these
papers, some extracts from notes taken at a most instructive debate last session upon the
motion (brought forward by <span class="smcap">Plumley Duff</span>; opposed by
<span class="smcap">Gaspard Hartupp</span>), that:</p>

<p>"In the opinion of this House, Science has been productive of more real benefit to the
Human Race than Art."</p>

<p>Somehow, although I know that <span class="smcap">Duff's</span> speech was compounded of plain common sense
interspersed with abundant facts (all <span class="smcap">Duff's</span> speeches are like that), I did not begin to take
notes that evening until <span class="smcap">Hartupp</span> had reached his peroration, which was in this form:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir," said <span class="smcap">Hartupp</span> (<i>with an inflection of unspeakable pathos in his voice, which ought
to make</i> <span class="smcap">Pinceney</span> <i>shed tears&mdash;but does not</i>), "before I sit down&mdash;before, Sir, I resume
my seat,"&mdash;(<i>this solemnly, as if he has a deep presentiment that he may never resume another
seat</i>)&mdash;"let me ask the Honourable Member who is responsible for the Motion on the paper
this evening&mdash;let me put to him this single inquiry, this solitary question&mdash;and I shall await
his answer with considerable curiosity." ... (<i>Here</i> <span class="smcap">Hartupp</span> <i>gazes with an air of challenge
at</i> <span class="smcap">Duff</span>, <i>who, however, is drawing</i> <span class="smcap">Euclid's</span> <i>first proposition upon his blotting-pad, an occupation
which seems to absorb the whole of his faculties for the moment</i>.) "Is he here to-night
to deny the existence of any good that is not visible, that is not tangible, that cannot be
measured with a tape, or weighed in scales? <i>Sir</i>, that is the philosophy of the volatile
sparrow, of the soulless hog, that skims the vault of the azure empyrean, and wallows
content in the mire of his native sky&mdash;I <i>should</i> say" (<i>with an air of careless concession to
prosaic accuracy</i>), "stye! That bird, Sir, that pig, like the Honourable Proposer himself"&mdash;(<i>a
titter here from the more frivolous</i>; <span class="smcap">Duff</span> <i>rubs his nose, and evidently wonders whether</i>
<span class="smcap">Hartupp</span> <i>has been saying anything worth noticing</i>)&mdash;"would find the universe none the poorer
had <span class="smcap">Praxiteles</span> carved nothing more immortal than an occasional cold fowl; had <span class="smcap">Homer</span>
swept his lyre, not in commemoration of the fall of an ancient Troy, but to celebrate the rise
of a new soap (<span class="smcap">Hartupp</span> <i>rather prides himself on his talent for antithesis</i>); "and had <span class="smcap">Titian</span>
lavished all his wealth of glowing colour and gorgeous hues upon the unretentive surface of
some suburban pavement! But, <i>Sir</i>, I hope that we, by our vote to-night, will afford no
encouragement to the gross and contemptible materialism which is the curse of the present
day, and of which, I am compelled to add," (<i>here he glances reproachfully at the unconscious</i>
<span class="smcap">Duff</span>, <i>who is sharpening a pencil</i>), "we have been afforded so melancholy an example this
evening. Let us proclaim to the world without that we, as Gentlemen and as Gargoyles,
repudiate, that we loathe, that we abhor, that we abominate," (<span class="smcap">Hartupp</span> <i>seems to be screwing
all these verbs out of himself, and throwing them defiantly at</i> <span class="smcap">Duff</span>,) "the grovelling tendency
of our animal nature to ignore the joys of the soul and the pleasures of the intellect,
and place its highest enjoyment in the ignoble pursuit of creature comforts!"</p>

<p class="hang">[<i>Here</i> <span class="smcap">Hartupp</span> <i>sits down amidst applause, and applies himself diligently to his
whiskey-and-water</i>.</p>

<p>At a later period in the evening, just as the debate was beginning to languish, <span class="smcap">Naylor</span>
started to his feet with a long strip of paper which, being shortsighted, he held close to
his nose. <span class="smcap">Naylor</span> invariably takes elaborate notes, with the intention of pointing out and
refuting the errors of all previous speakers. Unfortunately, as he cannot always read the
notes, and seldom remembers the objections he meant to urge, his criticisms are not as
effective as could be desired. On this occasion, <span class="smcap">Naylor</span> said:&mdash;"I'm not going to make a
speech, Sir, I only want to point out one or two things which struck me as requiring to be met.
I'll take them in their order." (<i>Here he fumbles with his strip of paper, which will get upside
down when he wished to refer to it</i>). "Oh, here it is! There was a Gargoyle who said&mdash;I
believe it was the Proposer of this motion&mdash;<i>didn't</i> you?" (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Duff</span>, <i>who shakes his head in
solemn disclaimer</i>). "Well, it was somebody, anyway, but he told us that&mdash;&mdash;." (<i>Here</i>
<span class="smcap">Naylor</span> <i>again refers to his notes</i>). "I'm afraid I can't exactly make out what he did say&mdash;but
I don't agree with him. Then there was another speaker who said, (I took it down
at the time) that he'd rather have a good traction-engine than the finest poem ever written!
Well, my reply to <i>that</i> is&mdash;&mdash;" (<i>here</i> <span class="smcap">Naylor</span> <i>has another wrestle with his notes and comes up
triumphant</i>) "that's <i>his</i> opinion. I wouldn't. Next, someone asked, 'What practical use
was <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span> to any man?'" (<i>A pause.</i>) "I've got an answer to that on my notes,
somewhere, only I can't find it. But, anyhow," (<i>cheerfully</i>) "I know it was rather sticking
up for <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>, to a certain extent. Then, didn't someone else say, 'Music elevated
the mind?'" (<i>A Member acknowledges the responsibility of this bold sentiment.</i>) "Well,
I don't say it doesn't&mdash;only, <i>how?</i> you know, that's the point!" (<i>A long pause, during
which</i> <span class="smcap">Naylor</span> <i>and his notes appears to be getting inextricably involved</i>). "There was a
lot of other things I meant to say, but I'm afraid I don't quite remember them at this
moment."</p>

<p>With this, <span class="smcap">Naylor</span> sat down suddenly, apparently very little depressed by the total
absence of applause&mdash;he knew that a fearless critic is never popular.</p>

<p>After that we had a little speech from dear old <span class="smcap">Kirkstone</span>, who rose to tell us an
anecdote, which the subject had suggested to him. Appropriate anecdotes are always
occurring to <span class="smcap">Kirkstone</span>, and he applies them in the neatest and happiest manner, being
gifted with the keenest sense of humour of any one in our Society. In fact, the very keenness
of <span class="smcap">Kirkstone's</span> appreciation operates almost as a disadvantage, as will be seen from
the following extract, taken on the spot.</p>

<p><i>Kirkstone (rising, and playing with his watch-chain).</i> "Sir, whilst listening to the speeches
<a class="pagenum" id="page_269" >[pg 269]</a>
of Honourable Members this evening, I could not help being
reminded of a story I heard the other day." (<i>Here a slight
spasm passes over his ample cheeks, and we all settle down in
delighted anticipation</i>). "There was an old farmer&mdash;one of the
regular old-fashioned sort." (<i>Faint preliminary chuckle down
in</i> <span class="smcap">Kirkstone's</span> <i>throat</i>.) "Well, he had a daughter, who&mdash;<i>tchick!</i>&mdash;played
on the&mdash;<i>tehee!</i>&mdash;the piano, and one day he was
induced to go in for a"&mdash;(<i>convulsion, followed by sounds like the
extraction of a very refractory cork</i>)&mdash;"for a Steam-plough! Soon
afterwards he happened to meet a friend&mdash;another farmer, or the
parson, I forget which, and it don't signify. Well, and the friend
asked 'how he got on with his Steam-plough.' And the old farmer
says&mdash;<i>hork-hork!</i>&mdash;he says, 'Don't talk to me 'bout no Steam-plough&mdash;<i>ki-hee-hee!</i>&mdash;when
there's my darter at home, and she&mdash;<i>crick,
crick, criggle!</i>' (<span class="smcap">Kirkstone</span> <i>proceeds gallantly, but is unintelligible
until the close</i>)&mdash;'with her darned pianner&mdash;<i>haw-haw-haw!</i>'
Well, the House can apply the moral of that themselves&mdash;I
thought it was rather to the point myself. That's all I got up
to say."</p>

<p>I am afraid <span class="smcap">Kirkstone</span> thinks we are all of us rather dull.</p>

<h2>A DRAMATIC ORATORIO.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width:25%">
<a href="images/illus269a.png">
<img src="images/illus269a.png" width="100%"  alt="Illustration" /></a>
</div>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frederic H. Cowen's</span> dramatic Oratorio, <i>Ruth</i>, was produced
last Thursday at St. James's Hall, and the verdict on the entire
work from "bar one" to bar last was emphatically favourable.
The Composer has nothing to regret on this
score. The workmanship throughout is thoroughly
good, and in some instances admirable, though the First
Part is not distinguished by any very striking originality.</p>

<p>In the Second Part, which begins appropriately with
Harvest or "Half-est time," Mr. <span class="smcap">Boaz Lloyd</span> gave a very
trying <i>scena</i> magnificently. But why does he pronounce
"excellent" as "ex<i>cee</i>lent?" Perhaps he has ascertained
on undeniable authority that this is the way <i>Boaz</i> would
have pronounced it. <i>&Agrave; propos</i>
of this eminent tenor, on one occasion, not this, there was very nearly
being a duel about his identity. An Irish gentleman, turning to
his friend, informed him, "That's <span class="smcap">Sims Reeves</span>," whereupon his
better informed companion returned, "He! <span class="smcap">Lloyd</span>!" which, but
for a toimely explanation, begorra, would have led to a challenge!</p>

<p>To resume. The "Dance of Reapers and Gleaners" must have
sounded rather out of place in Worcester Cathedral, where <i>Ruth</i>
was first produced. In the Chorus of the Reapers and Gleaners,
who were not in the least out of breath with their dance&mdash;but
perhaps these had only been delighted spectators&mdash;full justice was
done to the finest number in the Oratorio&mdash;at least, so it appeared to
the humble individual who had the honour of representing you on
this occasion. Then in the duet,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><span class="smcap">Lloyd</span> and <span class="smcap">Albani</span></p>
  <p class="i2">As <i>Boaz</i> and <i>Ruth</i>,</p>
<p>Were perfect, no blarney,</p>
  <p class="i2">I'm telling the truth.</p>
</div>

<p>The applause was enthusiastic: indeed, not only in this instance,
but throughout the performance, these two sang magnificently.
<i>Boaz</i> must have been a very kind man; at all events, as <i>Boaz</i>
and <i>Ruth</i> are invariably heard of together, it is clear that he
could never be accused of being Ruthless.</p>

<p>Now, just one question: the Book of Words with musical phrases, is
sold in the room, and on the title-page we read that "the words are
selected,"&mdash;most judiciously too&mdash;by Mr. <span class="smcap">Joseph Bennett</span>, and
"the Book of Words" is fitted "with analytical notes by <span class="smcap">Joseph
Bennett</span>,"&mdash;though we should have thought that Mr. <span class="smcap">Cowen's</span> notes
were sufficient by themselves. Then we find the analytical Noter
saying at the end of Part I., "<i>The assertion may safely be made,
that no poetical situation in dramatic Oratorio, has been treated more
successfully than the foregoing.</i>" Now, suppose this were a book of
a new Opera, would it be right and proper for the librettist who had
adapted the subject from <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>, for example, to give his
opinion on the work of his <i>collaborateur</i>? Wouldn't this be taking
an unfair advantage of his position? It doesn't matter in this case,
as I perfectly agree with him, but it is the principle, whatever it
may be, for which I contend, and sign myself,</p>

<p>Amongst entertainments of a pleasing character the performances
of "Mr. and Mrs. <span class="smcap">German Reed</span>" hold their own gallantly. At
the present moment a little play
called <i>Tally Ho</i> is occupying the
boards, much to the delight of
those serious pleasure-seekers who
consider a box at a theatre wicked,
but find no particular harm in
the stalls of St. George's Hall.
Mr. <span class="smcap">Alfred Reed</span> and Miss
<span class="smcap">Fanny Holland</span> are as amusing
as ever, and the music is all that
could be desired. The dialogue
of the piece, or entertainment,
or whatever it is, is not too new.
I fancy the author must have
seen <i>London Assurance</i>, and
listened to <i>Lady Gay Spanker's</i>
description of the fox chase.
And having seen the piece and
heard the speech, possibly read
the burlesque thereon by the late <span class="smcap">Gilbert Abbott &agrave; Beckett</span>, in
the <i>Scenes from Rejected Comedies</i>, published as long ago as the
forties. "How time flies!" as a lady behind me observed, after
expressing her opinion that Mr. <span class="smcap">Corney Grain</span> was better than his
pupil&mdash;<span class="smcap">John Parry</span>! "I remember him as far back as a quarter of
a century," continued the fair dame, "and didn't you hear him say
he was over fifty years old when he sang that song calling himself
an old fogey?" Mr. <span class="smcap">Grain</span> fails to do himself justice when he
assumes an elderly air inconsistent with the number of his summers.
Such an assumption can but cause pain&mdash;to his contemporaries!</p>

<p>On Thursday last <i>The Woman Hater</i> was produced for the first time
in London at Mr. <span class="smcap">Terry's</span> Theatre (on the grounds that familiarity
breeds contempt, I prefer to allow the actor to retain his titular
prefix), with more or less success. On the whole I condole with our
country cousins if they have been allowed to see this strange play
very frequently. Personally I would not care to form a part of any
audience at Mr. <span class="smcap">Terry's</span> Theatre during its run, which I am bound
to add I am afraid will not be a long one. The construction of the
three-act farce (as it is called) is feeble in the extreme, and suggests
that the author, from a literary point of view, has a great deal to
learn. I do not think (unless his future pieces are very unlike <i>The
Woman Hater</i>) that he will have much chance of gaining a permanent
position in the Temple of Fame. This is merely a matter of
opinion, but, speaking for myself, had I a theatre (which I should
call of course Mr. Thingembob's Theatre, or the Theatre Royal Dash
Blank, Esq.), I believe I should somehow or other instinctively avoid
the works of Mr. <span class="smcap">David Lloyd</span> for some time to come. That is to
say if he confined his pen to farce and comedy. It is quite possible
he may be much more at home in tragedy. As a fact, there is a sort
of gloomy glamour about <i>The Woman Hater</i> that suggests the
reflection that, after all, the play might have been more exciting if
a murder had been skilfully introduced into Act I., and it had been
written throughout in blank verse. I think the lover, <i>Tom Ripley</i>,
might thus have been murdered with or without (for preference,
with) his sweetheart. Early in Act II. the character very nicely
played by Mr. <span class="smcap">Kemble</span> might have committed suicide, with one or
two others; for choice, others. Act III. might have been allowed
(after the necessary alterations had been made to fit it to the
requirements of the novel development of the original plot)
to stand as it is. In its present form the incidents connected
with the spiriting away (after a desperate and revolting
fight with the keepers) of the hero to a Lunatic Asylum,
are, to say the least, unpleasant. Mr. <span class="smcap">Bishop</span>, as the psychological
specialist (the resident medical superintendent of the
licensed house), was excellent. It is a question, however, whether
those well-intentioned representatives of the <span class="smcap">Lord Chancellor</span>, the
Commissioners in Lunacy, would have been entirely satisfied with
his action in connection with the incarceration of one sane patient in
the place of another patient equally free from mental disease. But
that is a matter affecting the author rather than the player. Miss
<span class="smcap">M. A. Victor</span>, as a widow lady of great wealth and superior position,
was, of course, quite in her element, and gave an admirable sketch
of a British matron from Belgravia or Mayfair. Mr. <span class="smcap">Terry</span>, too,
deserves a word of praise for his own droll performances, which
caused more than once, on the first night, a burst of hearty laughter.
Pleasantry apart, in spite of the acting, good all round, I fear <i>The
Woman Hater</i> will soon have to return to the provinces, to make
room for something just a little better suited to the London requirements
of Mr. <span class="smcap">Terry</span> and the audiences of Mr. <span class="smcap">Terry's</span> Theatre.</p>

<h2>THE OLDEST SKETCHING CLUB IN THE WORLD.</h2>

<p>At the house of <span class="smcap">Nat Langham</span> young men
were taught how to use their hands skilfully
years agone; at the home of <i>the</i> <span class="smcap">Langham</span>
their hands are trained with equal care and
discretion, with a different end in view. At
the former they were excited, at the latter
they are soothed. The spirits of the last are
finer, if less ardent, than those of the first.
Friday cannot be unlucky, for all their
sketches are produced on that proverbially unfortunate
day. A subject is given, and in two
hours, over pipes and coffee, it is completed.
Marvellous these rapid acts of sketchmanship!
The Impressionists nowhere! The result?
Well, go to the Gallery, 23, Baker Street.
Look at the collection of pictures&mdash;on the
two hours' system&mdash;by Messrs. <span class="smcap">Stacey Marks</span>,

<p>The Crown Prince was reported last week
to be decidedly better. May it be so, and so
go on. "His Imperial Highness," wrote the
Correspondent of the <i>Standard</i>, "continues
to express the fullest confidence in Sir <span class="smcap">Morell
Mackenzie</span>." And <i>Mr. Punch</i>, in the name
of all Englishmen who are uninfluenced by any
feeling akin to professional jealousy, "says

<p>Mrs. R. is astonished that the English do
not name streets and places after the names of
their great Poets and their works. She says
she only remembers two exceptions; one was
a <i>Hamlet</i> in the Country, and the other was
<i>Wandsworth</i>; the latter being so called after
the Poet who wrote <i>The Excursion</i>,&mdash;probably,
she thinks, a cheap excursion to this

<h2>A DISPUTED WILL.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Mr. <span class="smcap">Donnelly's</span> cryptogram, showing <span class="smcap">Bacon</span> to be the author of
all <span class="smcap">Shakspeare's</span> plays, is a wonderful discovery. The principle only needs to be
applied with sufficient ingenuity and perseverance, to revolutionise the whole
field of literary history. I myself have only had time to apply it in a few
instances, but have already got the really valuable result that <span class="smcap">Negretti</span> and
<span class="smcap">Zambra</span> wrote most of the works of <span class="smcap">Milton</span>. <span class="smcap">Day</span> and <span class="smcap">Martin Luther</span> wrote
<i>Sandford and Merton</i>, and Sir <span class="smcap">Walter Scott</span> wrote the ballad with the refrain
"<i>Two Lovely Black Eyes</i>." <span class="smcap">Charles Thackeray's</span> works were entirely written
by <span class="smcap">William Makepeace Dickens</span>. Hence the cryptogrammatic name. I am
working as hard at the theory as the somewhat unelastic rules of this establishment
will permit, and this morning I caught a cryptogram crawling up the
window-pane. Aha! excuse my glove, I must dissemble,</p>

<p><i>Colney-Hatchwell</i>. <span class="author">Yours,
<span class="i6 smcap">The "B" in Both.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;You are performing a truly noble and philanthropic work in throwing
open your columns to a subject which must inevitably seem "<i>caviare</i> to the
general" (<span class="smcap">Bacon</span>). To myself, personally, the raising of the controversy at the
present time is annoying, because I happen to have hit independently on exactly
the same idea as Mr. <span class="smcap">Donnelly's</span>; viz., that there is an underground narrative
running through <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>. <span class="smcap">Darwin</span> and <span class="smcap">Wallace</span>, you may remember,
discovered the origin of species simultaneously, so why not I and <span class="smcap">Donnelly</span> the
origin of <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>? But my cryptogram leads to an entirely different result
from Mr. <span class="smcap">Donnelly's</span>, who has, I am certain, being led off on a false scent.
Instead of multiplying every 270th word, as he does, by the number of full-stops
in the page, and then dividing the result by the number of years during which
<span class="smcap">Anne Hathaway</span> is supposed to have resided at Stratford-on-Avon, he should
first have discovered the total quantity of words in all <span class="smcap">Shakspeare's</span> plays and
sonnets, and after that the quantity in the <i>Novum Organon</i>; then reducing the
probable salary which <span class="smcap">Bacon</span> received as Lord Chancellor, <i>each year</i>, down to
farthings, he should have divided (<i>not</i> multiplied) them all into each other, and
brought them to decimals, and then applied <i>that</i> result to the plays. The process
is a little complicated, but I can't make it clearer at present. Anyhow, the
entrancing interest of the story so obtained can be judged from the headings of
the chapters.</p>

<p>"Lord <span class="smcap">Bacon</span> arrives at Stratford disguised as a bargee. His midnight visit
to <span class="smcap">Shakspeare's</span> house. The poaching plot hatched. In the churchyard. The
Ghost among the tombs. The Ghost discovered to be Queen <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, who had
followed <span class="smcap">Bacon</span> to Stratford disguised as a Tilbury fish-wife. The Queen buried
alive in Stratford churchyard by <span class="smcap">Bacon</span> and <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>. The good Vicar
bribed. Their scheme to dress up <span class="smcap">Anne Hathaway</span> as
Queen. Its success. <span class="smcap">Anne Hathaway</span> reigns twenty
years, everybody taking her for <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>. <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>
(stricken with remorse) appears suddenly at the bedside
of <span class="smcap">Bacon</span>. Threatens to disclose all. <span class="smcap">Bacon</span> murders
<span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>. Takes all <span class="smcap">Shakspeare's</span> Plays (hitherto
unacted, having been rejected by the Managers of the
period as 'wholly devoid of dramatic power') out of his
pocket, and produces them next day as his own. Success
of this plot also. How <span class="smcap">Bacon</span> repents at last. Invents
the Cryptogram. Inserts it in the Plays on his deathbed."</p>

<p>You will see from this abstract that there are elements
of far greater interest in my theory than in Mr. <span class="smcap">Donnelly's</span>,
and my publishers sincerely trust that you will
insert this letter, as a gratuitous advertisement may help
the sale of my forthcoming work, entitled, <i>Who Killed
Shakspeare and Queen Elizabeth?</i>

<span class="author">Your obedient servant,     <span class="i6 smcap">Artful Plodder.</span></span> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Surely it is impossible to doubt any longer that
<span class="smcap">Bacon</span> wrote <i>Hamlet</i>. Why, in that play you find him
actually confessing his cowardice in not claiming the
authorship of his own plays! What else <i>can</i> these words
mean?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth
and heaven? We are <i>arrant knaves all</i>."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then occurs this truly remarkable sentence:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"God hath given you one face, and you make yourselves
another."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given <i>whom</i>? Why, <span class="smcap">Bacon</span> himself! Did he not make
his face into another's, namely, <span class="smcap">Shakspeare's</span>? The
case is as clear as noonday. Let the insular cavillers at
<span class="smcap">Donnelly</span>, just because he is an American, hide their
diminished heads.

<span class="author smcap">Anti-Humbug.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Would one of your readers kindly inform
me how Friar <span class="smcap">Bacon</span> could have written <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>?
I see by <i>Little Arthur's History of England</i> that the
former lived three hundred years before <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span> was
born. This seems to be a conclusive proof that Mr. <span class="smcap">Donnelly</span>
is wrong; but though I am very fond of history, I
do not profess to be a great historical critic.

<span class="author smcap">Tilly Slowboy.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;In looking over <i>Macbeth</i>, I have found a really
remarkable confirmation of Mr. <span class="smcap">Donnelly's</span> cryptographic
story. The story relates how, when <span class="smcap">Cecil</span> told Queen
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> that <span class="smcap">Shakspeare's</span> plays were treasonable,
she "rises up, beats <span class="smcap">Hayward</span> with her crutch, and
nearly kills him." In Act III., Scene 4, of <i>Macbeth</i>,
occurs this line,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center small">"It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood"&mdash;</p>

<p><i>i.e.</i>, Queen <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, being a person of good blood, or
high lineage, <i>will</i> have blood, <i>i.e.</i>, from the head of the
person she beats with the crutch.</p>

<p>A few lines further on is a striking confirmation of this.</p>

<p><i>Macbeth</i> says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>"How say'st thou, that <span class="smcap">Macduff</span> denies his person</p>
<p>At our great bidding?"</p>
</div>

<p><i>Macduff</i> here is cryptographic for <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>. When
summoned by the Queen to answer <span class="smcap">Cecil's</span> charge, <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>
<i>did</i> deny his person at her bidding. Mr. <span class="smcap">Donnelly's</span>
is a great discovery. The world <i>does</i> advance, in
spite of Lord <span class="smcap">Salisbury</span>.      <span class="author">Yours,
<span class="i6 smcap">Radical.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;How long will the British public allow an
impudent Yankee to lead it astray? Mr. <span class="smcap">Donnelly</span> has
evidently never read my historical novel, <i>A Tale of the
Invincible Armada</i>, which somehow failed to meet with
the enthusiasm it deserved, or he would know that <span class="smcap">Cecil</span>
valued <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span> most highly. In my book he never
addresses the Bard without saying, "Marry, Gossip," or
"I' faith, good coz." I am sure your readers will be glad
of this information; also to hear that I am bringing out a
cheap popular edition of the same book, price only three-and-sixpence.
Order at once,      <span class="author">Yours,      <span class="i6 smcap">M. Ainchance.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Perhaps, after all, the best solution of the <span class="smcap">Shakspeare-Bacon</span>
puzzle is one analogous to that suggested
by a learned Don in the <span class="smcap">Homer</span> controversy&mdash;viz., that
the person who wrote the plays was not <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>, but
another man of the same name.

<h2>ON THEATRICAL PICTURE-POSTERS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I used to be a very regular attendant at the Theatres. I
am not so now, and I find that by staying away, I have time at
my disposal, which I never had before, for reading, study, and social
intercourse. I save my money and preserve my health. And for
this I have most sincerely to thank the Managers of our London
Theatres, who, within the last few years, have adopted a style of
pictorial advertisement, which, though possibly attractive to simple-minded
folk, or restless youth, exercises a singularly deterrent effect
on the middle-aged playgoer, and on all imaginative and timid
persons, especially of the feminine gender.</p>

<p>For example, speaking as a medi&aelig;valist, or one of the middle-ages,
if I see a huge coloured picture on a hoarding representing several
sensational situations which form a frame for the culminating horror
of the play in the centre, as an old stager I know that play from
beginning to end, and take in the whole plot at a glance. I can
imagine the dialogue without doing much injury to the author, and,
as I have seen the principal actors and actresses, I can, in my own
mind, furnish the piece with a cast probably far superior to that at
the particular theatre where the melodrama, thus pictorially advertised,
is being performed. The scenery and costumes I have before
me on the hoarding. This applies to several theatres. As to
timid ladies they shrink from seeing the realisation of the terrible
situations depicted on the picture-poster. They have seen quite
enough: they will wait until something less startling shall be
substituted for this display of crime, cruelty, and violence.</p>

<p>It is really very kind of the Managers to provide for outsiders in
this way, but the outsiders remain outsiders, and have no desire to
enter these chambers of Dramatic Horrors. As a supporter of shows
and exhibitions, with considerable experience, I know well enough
that the representation outside the booth is very much superior to
the reality within; for example, the outside picture of a Fat
Woman exaggerates the corpulence of the Lady on view inside the
caravan; the Mermaid is most attractive in the picture, probably
floating about playing a harp, while the reality is a dummy figure
composed of a monkey's and cat's skin sewn together and stuffed.
I hope the Managers will develop their pictorial advertisements
still further; I speak selfishly, as if everyone takes my view,
where will the audiences be?</p>

<p>The only advertisements that ever attract me, and cause me to
say, "Ah! I should like to see <i>that</i>!" are those which, on closer
inspection, I find to be only the artistic trade-marks of some new soap,
beetle-powder, peculiar whiskey, sewing machines, or soothing
syrup. Pray, Sir, do all you can to encourage Theatrical Art in
Mural Decorations, and save the time and money of,

<span class="author">Yours,      <span class="i6 smcap">Pater Familias.</span></span> </p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I shall take my boys in holiday time the round of the
hoardings, and tell them all about the plays. Cheap entertainment,

<p>"I am heartily glad you have come," said the Commander-in-Chief

<p>"I glanced at it, but could not get through it," replied <i>the</i> Field
Marshal. "What does he say?"</p>

<p>"Well, so far as I can make out, that in the time of war all the
Militia will be drafted into the Army, and all the Coast Guards into
the Navy, and both will disappear together with the Army and the
Navy in the first battle."</p>

<p>"Anything else?"</p>

<p>"Well," continued <span class="smcap">George Ranger</span>, re-opening the Magazine,
"he seems to think that we have got enough men, if we can't get
more, but that we must defend India with the aid of compulsory
service, although, for various 'religious and commercial reasons,
almost peculiar to England, the non-adoption of Conscription is
certain.'"</p>

<p>"From this I take it the article is slightly mixed?"</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;and I am bothered entirely!" replied the poor Duke, who
had a habit, when worried, of returning to the brogue he used as
Prince <span class="smcap">George</span> in Ireland, in his youth. "What will I do? Look
there now, we have cut down everything to starvation proportions, to

<p>Two months later Europe, shaken by the mightiest conflict of this
century, was beginning to regain her composure. It would be unwise
(for it might offend foreign susceptibilities) to give the names
of the victories that had added fresh lustre to the British arms.
Suffice it to say that not a single reverse had been recorded. Once
more <i>the</i> Field Marshal entered the room of the Commander-in-Chief
(patented).</p>

<p>"Well, <span class="smcap">George</span>, how goes it?" asked the foremost soldier of
the age. The Commander-in-Chief (patented) fell upon his knees
and kissed the spurs of his master's boots.</p>

<p>"Nay, this show of gratitude is pleasing, but embarrassing.
Remember, <span class="smcap">George</span>, you are of Royal Blood," and <i>the</i> Field-Marshal
gently and kindly assisted the Patented One to rise.</p>

<p>"I cannot help it," returned <span class="smcap">George</span>, with a burst of almost painful
emotion. "You have done so much for us."</p>

<p>"Not at all," observed <i>Punch</i> with a smile, "that packet certainly
contained a few suggestions of some value."</p>

<p>"Why, they saved the country! How should we have horsed the
Cavalry and Artillery, if we had not entered on peace contracts with
the Directors of Pickford's, the London General Omnibus Company,
the Road Cars, the Tramways, and the Herne Bay Bathing Machine
Owners. The last were not easily persuaded to act with us, as
somehow the requisition of their quadrupeds seemed to interfere with
the success of the Thanet Harriers."</p>

<p>"But they gave in at last?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, patriotism was the rule without exception. Then
the compulsory service of their <i>employ&eacute;s</i> in the Volunteers, insisted
upon by all the West End Tradesmen and employers of labour
throughout the land, had the best effects. Why some of the finest
troops in the world came from <span class="smcap">Schoolbred's</span>, <span class="smcap">Whiteley's</span>, the Army
and Navy Stores, and <span class="smcap">Smith and Sons</span>."</p>

<p>"And the Inns of Court, the Universities, and the Medical
Colleges also insisted upon continued efficient service in the Volunteer
ranks to secure the advantage of audience in the Courts and Registration
as Doctors, didn't they?"</p>

<p>"Certainly! Oh, it was grand! Then we got as much Cavalry
as we required from the farmers, and the Yeomanry, and purchased
the entire stock of guns from the Continent.&mdash;Just as you told me
to do."</p>

<p>"Quite right," said <i>Punch</i>, "after all, guns and ammunition are
only a question of figures. I suppose the British Army in India was
recalled home and distributed amongst the Colonies, as I suggested,
and the Native Troops that were not quite trustworthy treated in
the same manner?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly, yes, and they have given an admirable account of
themselves in Australia and Canada." Then <span class="smcap">George</span> hesitated.
"But you would not tell me how you supplied their places in India.
You merely asked for transport for your Army of Reserves."</p>

<p>"Quite so," said <i>Punch</i>, with a smile. "But, now that peace is
decided upon, and all but declared, I need keep silence no longer.
The fact is, I fought the Russians with an Army of Germans and
Italians, under the command of my friend Sir <span class="smcap">Frederick Roberts</span>."</p>

<p>"Germans and Italians! Where <i>did</i> you get them from?"</p>

<p>"From places where they were ruining our working-poor and doing
themselves no permanent good. I shipped them from Hatton Garden
and Whitechapel. My country saved, the welfare of the world in
general demands my restored attention. It shall have it."</p>

<p>And full of this truly benevolent intention, <i>Mr. Punch</i> returned
to Fleet Street.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> <i>The Personal Remembrances</i> of Sir <span class="smcap">Frederick Pollock</span>
(<span class="smcap">Macmillan &amp; Co.</span>) I had, I confess, expected a great deal more
than I found in the two
volumes. And I hold that
I had a right to expect
something more than usually
interesting from the
Remembrances of the
Queen's Remembrancer.
What Sir <span class="smcap">Frederick</span> remembers
as Remembrancer
to the <span class="smcap">Queen</span> is very little,
though quite sufficient for
the office; but his own recollections
as his own
Remembrancer are very
pleasant reading, being full
of information given in an unpretentious conversational style, about
Cambridge University life, the Bench and the Bar, and Literary
Society generally. There is a good deal of eating and drinking
recorded&mdash;not too much, perhaps, for the necessities of social life;
and the "C. C. S.," or Cambridge Conversazione Society seems to
have been very regular in its intellectual gatherings at various places
where good food is provided. This Club, limited to twelve members,
was called somewhat profanely "The Twelve Apostles," though of
what they were Apostles I cannot make out. They have evidently
an Apostolic Succession, as the Club is still in existence, I believe.
Altogether, among this sudden glut in the market of literary confidences
in the shape of ducal, journalistic, artistic, and egotistic
recollections, this may be taken up as a chatty and readable book.</p>

<p><i>Woman's World</i> for December, edited by our <span class="smcap">Oscar Wilde</span>, is
full of woman's wit, and some of the illustrations, especially in the
department of The Fashions, are charming. What a change from
the old style of painted doll inanities, dressed up in a style never
seen in real life! The picture of the three pretty women preparing
for a ball is a candle to attract male moths&mdash;"male moths" being
obviously the opposite to "ma'am&mdash;moths," as that undefeated
punster <span class="smcap">Samuel Johnson</span> would have said under certain circumstances.
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Campbell Praed's</span> account of Royat is very amusing;
but, though I have been several times up to La Charrade, yet
never have I had the good fortune to come across Madame <span class="smcap">Grenon</span>,
who, if her portrait, as given in this number, is a genuine likeness,
ought to be one of the attractions of the environs of Royat. Good,
honest, kindly faces I saw at Charrade, but why this uncommonly
pretty one hid herself, as she must have done whenever she
saw this distinguished water-drinker coming to Charrade is a charade
to me. The general remarks on the Stage by the lamented Authoress
of <i>John Halifax</i>, whose recent loss we all deplore, are very interesting,
as recording the impressions of a good, pure-minded
woman, whose acquaintance with the <i>vie intime</i> of the Theatre was
limited. The portraits of Miss <span class="smcap">Anderson</span> are not particularly
flattering&mdash;rather shady, which is the one thing that no one shall
ever unchallenged say of our sweet and gentle <i>Perdita</i> in the hearing
of your rather deaf

<span class="author smcap">Polixenes, Baron de Book Worms.</span></p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project

the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
